Just checked another project off the list for The Odin Project! I built this landing page from zero, mostly to get my head around Flexbox and clean layout logic. It’s cool to see it all finally click. Now that the styling is out of the way, I’m officially starting JavaScript today. Ready to actually make things do stuff!
